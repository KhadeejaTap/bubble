Web Dev Blog

Web development is a process consisting of the following steps: gathering information, planning, design and layout, content creation, development, testing/rev/launch, maintenance; my process has been documented.

Gathering Relevant Information

Objectives – learn PHP and become comfortable with JS and HTML/CSS.

Target audience – friends and hiring companies

Requirements – Figma and a basic IDE

Planning – Wireframe

A sitemap is unnecessary since this project is simple

Wireframe – made in Figma

Tech stack – PHP, JS & JS libraries, HTML/CSS

Roadmap –

Day 1) Planning, Wireframe – 3hr

Day 2) Start frontend with HTML/CSS – 2hr

Interactivity with JS & PHP – 4hr

Day 3) Finish & deploy 4hr

Design & Layout

Focus on functionality & keep it simple

Content Creation

Chose a name & title

Chose a call to action (CTA)

Development

Testing and Quality Assurance

I did a bit of testing and ran into bugs which I fixed. 

Deployment

I made a readme with instructions and added files to GitHub

(a more detailed plan would be needed if working in a team)
